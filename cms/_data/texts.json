However, managing and scaling infrastructure is a challenge for small and mid-sized VFX studios. They need not only capital but also the right talent to build their infrastructure. We team up with small and upcoming studios and even struggling freelancers who find it hard to remain sustainable in the industry. We have a network of studios located in Serbia, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Moscow, Poland, and many others. This concept has helped strengthen our in-house team of 35-40 people to 500+ powerful performers across the world. Our journey has been enriched by key entrepreneurs across the globe. We fondly call them 'Keypreneurs'. It is our belief that training and grooming new resources will elevate the overall level of work. Our emphasis remains on international collaborations focusing on sourcing experience, talent, skills, and creativity. By offering these studios ample exposure, we help them garner good work and fame and expand their reach. We bridge the gap between international talent and the needs of the clients, ensuring that the quality of the end product is incomparable.",
